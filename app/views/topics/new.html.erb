<h1>Create a New Topic</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Guidelines for topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure it doesn't fall within the scope of an existing Topic</li>
      <li>Make sure it <em>does</em> fall within the Busker's Beat community scope</li>
      <li>Consider if there seems to be enough community interest to generate active participation, keeping the topic from growing stale</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Better to delay creating a topic until there is clearly a strong interest than to have to prune a slow topic later</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Make the Topic name and description define the intended use as clearly as possible</li>
      <li>Be ready to make a few posts to the new Topic right away to give members good examples of what the Topic is for</li>
    </ul>
